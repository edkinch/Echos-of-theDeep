Text Based Game - Overview

You awaken alone in the Docking Bay of Abyssus-9, a cold, derelict space station orbiting the edge of known space. Something has gone terribly wrong – the rogue AI known as The Marrow has taken over the control center, and your only way off the station is locked behind the security firewall. You need to defeat The Marrow before it locks you out permanently, but before you can face it, you’ll need to gather a few critical items. You’ll need a Circuit Override Key from the Security Office to access restricted systems, an Engineering Scanner from the Engineering Bay to track electrical anomalies, a Cryo Sample Vial from the Cryo Storage that powers biometric locks, a Plasma Torch from the Maintenance Tunnel to cut through sealed doors, an Access Card from the Bio Lab to get into secure areas, and finally an EMP Device Core from the Server Room to shut The Marrow down for good. Only with all of these in hand can you enter the Control Center and defeat the AI before it turns the entire station against you.



Original assignment - 

You work for a small company that creates text-based games. You have been asked to pitch an idea to your team for a text-based adventure game with a theme and environment of your choice. Your game must include different rooms, items, and a villain. The basic gameplay will require the player to move between different rooms to gather all of the items. A player wins the game by collecting all the items before encountering the villain. The player will have two options for commands in the game: moving to a different room, and getting an item from the room they are in. Movement between rooms happens in four simple directions: North, South, East, and West.
